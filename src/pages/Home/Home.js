      <h1>Erik J Brown Tech LLC</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a full-stack web app developer who's passionate about the <b>MERN</b> stack. This involves
        MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately I have been using Digital Ocean to host my droplets (ec2 instances), Google Firebase
        for web client hosting, MongoDB Atlas for a cloud DBaaS, GitHub for a code repo, and then Namecheap
        for domains. The droplet simply uses Nginx and PM2 for running the Node app.
      </p>

      <p>
        I haven't decided between AWS or DO for an S3 solution to host images. I also have been working with a
        Docker Swarm of three droplets on DO, but I'd like to improve my Docker understanding further before
        containerizing my apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary tools are <b>Visual Studio Code</b>, MongoDB Compass, Postman, & Docker Desktop.
        I like to use WSL2 w/ Ubuntu on Windows Terminal for my shell.
      </p>

      <p>
        For project management I have been using Jira with kanban boards and also trying Confluence for project documentation.
        I haven't settled on a time tracking app yet, and just use a pen and a time tracking journal.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a life outside of coding as well. Some of the things
        I spend time on include mountain biking, bowling, video games, RC cars, & PCs.
      </p>
