      <h1>Short Bio</h1>

      <p>
        React got me interested in web development. I couldn't find interesting local jobs and I
        needed experience, so I started learning on my own and working as a freelancer. Now I'm a
        MERN stack web developer and still trying to both learn and work at the same time.

      <h1>Long Bio</h1>

      <p>
        I always liked technical things, back to when my dad brought me a computer home from his work. Then
        I grew up playing video games and in middle school started working on RC cars, before building computers
        in high school. It was awesome to figure out PC builds and I liked helping friends with their computers
        also. I decided to go into technology and work towards computer engineering after high school.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an engineering student, I mostly worked with C++ and C, with some Java and Assembly for a
        Freescale HCS12 microcontroller. Then during internships I got exposed to SQL Server and ASP.NET.
        I got really interested in web development and decided to work towards doing this for a career.
      </p>

      <p>
        I knew that I didn't want to work with ASP.NET because the potential seemed limited. I had worked with
        React during my second internship and thought it was awesome. The way the technology worked was much
        cooler than the legacy ASP.NET framework app that I had been maintaining. I decided to work on being
        the type of developer that would use this, but jobs in my area were focused on ASP.NET and a lot of the
        qualifications were simply unrealistic. This got me onto the idea of working freelance, but I knew that
        I needed more training as well in order to provide the proper assistance to potential clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        My web development focus started with React and shifted to Node.js. I played around with Serverless
        in the beginning but went to using Node.js and decided to focus on learning concepts with this approach
        primarily. To me, understanding the constraints of one method helps to figure out the benefits of another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, I went into Udemy courses to learn about developing an app with EJS templates with an
        MVC structure and MongoDB Atlas. Next was CRUD operations with building a REST api, and then
        converting that to a GraphQL api. Afterwards I spent time with React and Redux, learned about hooks,
        and built a frontend React spa that utilized Firebase services.
