# shared-meta

The main purpose of the shared directory is to hold content that can
later be extracted into separate packages for use with other react
projects I'll work on.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-meta` to execute the unit tests via [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
