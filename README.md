### Sites for ErkjbroTech (currently hosted on Amplify)

- [Production](https://erkjbro.tech)
- [Staging](https://dev.erkjbro.tech)

Currently, this site is in development to make use of Nx, Vite, and Styled Components.
I've been working with mostly Python for 2022, so I'm trying to modernize my approach
for frontend tooling and try out some different design patterns in the process.

## Development server

Run `nx serve erkjbro-tech` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
