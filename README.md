## Pull Request Guidelines
   * Fetch the latest main: `git pull origin main` or `git fetch origin main` (Don't forget to stay on `main` branch)
   * Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-branch`.
   * Make your changes and commit often.
   * Were commits pushed to `origin`? If so, you should rebase your branch. Fetch with `git fetch origin main` and run
   `git rebase main`.
   * Resolve conflicts on each commit. Do it with `kdiff3` or anything that suits you. Add these modification and run `git rebase --continue` until you've cleared all conflicts.
   * Test your code.
   * Push your code.
      - If the branch is new, you just use `git push origin myNewBranch`.
      - If you had to rebase, you'll need to force the push with `git push origin myNewBranch -f`.
   * Create the PR and point to the `main` Branch.
